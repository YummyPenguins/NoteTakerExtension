Note Taker Extension for Web Pages

## Sub-Heading ##
The target audience is anyone who needs a way to keep track of specific parts of web pages they visit.

## Summary ##
In today's society, it is virtually impossible to avoid using the internet whether it is for work, entertainment, or communicating with others across the globe. That being said, every web page is organized differently and it is often very difficult to keep track of them let alone specific parts of them manually. This product aims to simplify the process by allowing the user to highlight portions of web pages and save them to their account as they surf the web. Later on, the user can go to a summary page to view the saved notes or quickly scroll through the parts of webpages for them.

## Problem ##
This product aims to make highlighting parts of web pages as well as keeping track of them easier--even if the user browses multiple pages that are unrelated to each other.

## Solution ##
Once logged in, the user is able to easily surf the internet and highlight portions of the web page. At any point, he could either go to a summary page and review the highlights or quickly scroll through them with a simple click of a button.
